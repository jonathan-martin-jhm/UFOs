# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis
### Purpose
Dana’s webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but she’d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results

The website can be used to search UFO sightings by using one of the five fields shown on the left of the website. Users can choose to use all or some of the five fields of date, city, state, country, and shape of the sighting to narrow down their search.

## Summary

The website can be used a powerful tool to search for UFO sightings throughout the world. One drawback to the site is the limited amount of data that can be searched for UFO sightings. One improvement that could be made to the site is increasing the amount of data available to query UFO sightings. A second improvement to the site could be to add a link to a map of where the sitings occurred.
